## Inspiration

This is an over-designed, karaoke-focused version of [Ken Daganioâ€™s](https://github.com/kendaganio)
excellent [jkbx](https://github.com/kendaganio/jkbx).

## Why?

I wanted to learn React and we have a lot of Karaoke parties.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
